Inventory management for POS

This project is aimed to keep a track on the inventory in a food outlet.
The front-end of this project is designed as an android mobile application.

The user needs to add the items present in stock, then he adds the menu with the quantity of items required to cook the dish. When the billing is done, the item quantity is automatically reduced from the inventory. The user can also set a threshhold and if an item goes below the set limit, he would get an alert regarding the same.
